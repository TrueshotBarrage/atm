Create an application called atm. 

The goal is to create a backend Spring application that allows users to track their account balances and deposit and withdraw money. 

This service should have several REST endpoints exposed to manage CRUD operations for the users. 

It is not necessary to setup an actual DB to store this information, the H2 database provided by Spring initializer should be sufficient for this. 

Once youâ€™re done, send me a link to the project in your GitHub and schedule a code review with me.
